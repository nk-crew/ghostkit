In the search field type Ghost Kit and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.

### Manual installation ###

The manual installation method involves downloading our Ghost Kit plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
